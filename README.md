This repository contains the solutions for all 4 assignments of CV. 

Each assignment has a document with all the screenshots. 

Note: If screenshots didn't seem relevant for a question, a video has been attached. Or relevant txt files could be found in the solution. 
All recordings have been shared through google drive. 

Models used for object tracking and detection were over 100 MB and hence could not be pushed to git. They have been included in the drive as well.
